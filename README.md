# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Data Zip File Location: [UC Irvine Repo](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip "Clicking will download the data")

## Goal of the Project
1. A tidy data set 
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Analysis R Script

## Repository files

* CodeBook.md - contains description of the variables in the table
* README.md
* run_analysis.R - contains source code
* tidyData.txt - the result dataset
* UCI HAR Dataset folder - contains all the data used in the project
* project.ipynb - contains source code in Jupyter notebook format with some more explanations
